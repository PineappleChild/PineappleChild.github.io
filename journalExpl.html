						<h3> What can we do to reduce Climate Change </h3>
						<p>While growing up my father always told me about the threat that climate change poses to my generation. I was young at the time, but regardless it seems frightening. He told me about the effects it would have on farms all over the world, the devastation to peopleâ€™s homes globally, and how it would make me and my sisters lives far more challenging than his. Of course, I tried my best to resolve this. I recycled and did what I was told, but I never really did anything significant to contribute to a solution. In middle school, my hobbies diversified. Previously I played legos and Mario Kart, but now I began to try new things. One of the new interests I picked up was growing tomato plants. I tried very hard to get the best tomatoes but everything was stacked against me, I was planting them in the winter and I did not regularly water them. So they died. It got me thinking about ways to improve how I could grow these plants. One of the solutions I came up with was growing them inside. A controlled climate with artificial light and optimal conditions for year-round tomatoes. After some convincing I got my dad to drive me to Home Depot and buy me the supplies, One large plastic storage box, some garden lights, and some dirt. I began my project immediately.  I set out the seeds and started to fill the container with the dirt. I then cut holes in the container lid to put the lights in. My father suggested I add an automatic dripping system, so I did. My indoor farm was complete. It was around February, so far from optimal planting time. After a few days, I saw some progress with my Tomatoes. A few weeks passed and I had tomatoes in March. I was jubilated. I ended the project and did not think much about it until a few weeks ago in my Junior year of high school.  I always wanted to serve a purpose to this planet, and my tomato project light a bulb in my head. I thought that if I were to be able to make indoor farms we could help reduce water wasted from over-irrigation, chemical use over large areas of land, and cut down the space it takes to farm massive amounts of food. I started with an irrigation system. I planned the farm to be in a warehouse where I could stack crops on top of each other to optimize how much could be grown in one place. The irrigation system is comprised of several pumps all rigged to one minicomputer, Arduino, which would control when the pumps would activate. This would allow optimization for different types of crops to be watered and for the least amount of water to be wasted. I thought it would be a good idea to have the system water the plants based on how moist the soil was. I went out and bought a humidity detector to try the system out. Unfortunately, it did not work because the humidity of air is different from that of soil. Luckily this was an easy fix, I bought a soil moisture meter to do this task. I hooked it up with the Arduino and began to program the tasks. The basic idea was to have the pumps activate when the soil was below average moisture. When the soil was back to a good moisture amount the pumps would stop the flow of water. I managed to get the pumps to work in separate conditions by using another moisture sensor and a circuit breaker attached to a brancher attached to the Arduino. This is, unfortunately, all I have done so far, but I plan to add a way to optimize the amount of electricity used by the artificial light using natural light to heat up water to create a power to reduce the amount of electricity I have to pay to keep the farm running. I think that the capabilities of this are endless. A way to reduce the amount of land being used and a way to farm from any climate in the world is fantastic. I would love to expand the farm,  but I am limited by the financial resources I have at the moment. I plan on getting a job over the summer so I can add some more plants and irrigation branches. All in all this project was inspired by the stories my dad told me about climate change, and I am forever grateful for his passion to help save the planet for my sister, my generation, and myself.

						<h3> An unlikely Inspiration </h3>
						<p>
						Ever since I was a kid I loved to play video games. I all started when I got my first console, a DIJI. I could play Sonic and other NES games on it. It was a blast until one Christmas my parents got my sister and I a Wii. It was fantastic. We would play Mario, Mario Kart, and a bunch of other games on it. All in all, it was a great thing to use to pass the time. A few years passed and I wanted to get a PS4. I decided to save up some money to get the console. It took several weekends of mowing my neighbor's lawns for me to have enough to buy my dream toy. It wasn't very long until I started to need a laptop for my school work. My parents gifted one to my sister and I. It was a Lenovo with Windows 7. I got straight to work figuring out how to use it and what I could do with it. This was around 2011 when these events happened. Coincidentally this was around the time I began to hear about Minecraft. I researched it and I needed to have the game. I used the leftover money from mowing lawns to buy a copy of the game for my laptop.  I was hooked. It allowed me to explore and create anything I wanted. I did not take me long to find out about a special item in the game called a command block. It was a gateway to being able to the future control of your world. They allowed you to execute any command while using coding basics, or Redstone. I got to work on making a minigame for my friends and I. It consisted of zombies that would attack us, and when we cleared all of them it would spawn more zombies based off our health and tools. This may seem basic, but Minecraft was a gateway to me getting interested in coding. Not long after my first minigame, I undertook to make a modification for Minecraft. It was a simple idea. A new item that would spawn a volley of eggs wherever it was directed to. I got my first taste of real coding using java as my medium. Unfortunately I took a break from these activities soon after because my laptop broke, but nevertheless, it inspired me to pursue more coding and eventually want to major in an area with that as its main focus.</p>
